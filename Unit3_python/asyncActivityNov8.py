What does it "string concatenation" mean? Please write your response as a string and also provide a code example of two variables being concatenated and output the result in your terminal.
if you are learning JavaScript you will be using the console.log() function.

if you are learning Pyhon you will be using the print() function.

Please list and describe three rules for creating variable names. Please provide your answer as a string.

Define each of the following variable name formats then provide a code example of how you would write them.

Camel case

Find the missing variable for each of the following assignment operaor code snippets
Python Version a = '?'

let b = a *b

print(b) // the output in the terminal should be 700.

Use the logical operators and evaluate the following variables to get the requested result.
Python Version

which logical operator would you use to reflect that the result between the code expressions are true. use the print function to output the result in the termial, then explain why you would use that particular logical operator using a string.
x= 10

y= 2

z= y*2

x > 1 _____ z==4

JavaScript Version

which logical operator would you use to reflect that the result between the code expressions below are false. Use the console.log() function to output the result in the termial, then explain why you would use that particular logical operator using a string.
var x= 12

var y= 2

var z= 12/4

x <= 12 _____ z < 10
