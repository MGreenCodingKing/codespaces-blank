My name is Muhammed green I am in 9th grade and what i plan to do after high school is to get a partime job and go to
college at standford university or another good computer science college.
Or trave for a while because travel, both domestic and international, is a great experience for a high school graduate.
Depending on your situation, you may have spent your entire life so far in the same state, so seeing new places can
really help you broaden your horizons and think bigger about what you want to do with your life.
