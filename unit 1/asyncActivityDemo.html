    <p>My name is Muhammed green I am in 9th grade and what i plan to do after high school is to get a partime job and
        go
        tocollege at standford university or another good computer science college.
        Or trave for a while because travel, both domestic and international, is a great experience for a high school
        graduate.
        Depending on your situation, you may have spent your entire life so far in the same state, so seeing new places
        can
        really help you broaden your horizons and think bigger about what you want to do with your life.</p>
